Certainly! Here's a description of the provided code along with the pin connections used:

**Code Description:**

The code is designed to run on a NodeMCU board and involves various sensors and components to create a Fisherman Border Alert system. It utilizes the Blynk platform for remote monitoring and control. The system integrates GPS for location tracking, DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring, a flame sensor to detect fires, an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances, and an infrared (IR) sensor to detect border crossings. Additionally, a relay is used to control a device, such as a water pump or light.

**Pin Connections:**

- **GPS Module:**
  - RX (GPS) to D4 (NodeMCU)
  - TX (GPS) to D5 (NodeMCU)

- **DHT11 Sensor:**
  - Data Pin to D2 (NodeMCU)

- **Flame Sensor:**
  - Output Pin to D0 (NodeMCU)

- **Ultrasonic Sensor:**
  - Trig Pin to D5 (NodeMCU)
  - Echo Pin to D6 (NodeMCU)

- **Relay:**
  - Signal Pin to D7 (NodeMCU)

- **IR Sensor:**
  - Signal Pin to D3 (NodeMCU)

**Code Explanation:**

1. The code starts by including necessary libraries, defining template and authentication parameters for Blynk, and setting up pin constants.

2. The setup function initializes various components, including GPS, DHT11, flame sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and Blynk connection. It also sets up intervals for periodic sensor readings.

3. The `checkGPS()` function checks if the GPS is connected and working properly. It prints an error message and displays a message on Blynk if no GPS data is received.

4. The `sendSensor()` function reads temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor and sends it to Blynk.

5. The `flameSensor()` function reads the flame sensor's value. If a flame is detected, it logs an event, sends a message to Blynk, and turns off a buzzer. If no flame is detected, it resets the state.

6. The `getSendData()` function was intended to handle data from an MQ2 gas sensor, but that part has been removed.

7. The `ultrasonic()` function measures distance using the ultrasonic sensor, sends the value to Blynk, and displays a message if the distance is less than 15 cm.

8. The `displayInfo()` function displays GPS-related information including latitude, longitude, speed, number of satellites, and bearing.

9. The `loop()` function continuously checks the IR sensor to detect border crossings. If a border is crossed, it sends an alert message to Blynk. It also monitors the state of the relay and updates LED widgets accordingly. The GPS information is processed within the loop, and Blynk and timer functionalities are executed.

Remember to set up your Blynk account, create the necessary widgets, and use the provided BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN in the code. Also, make sure to connect the hardware components according to the pin connections mentioned above.




Virtual pins:

BORDER_CROSSED_ALERT_PIN (V12): This virtual pin is used to control an LED widget in the Blynk app. When the IR sensor detects a border crossing, the code turns on the LED widget associated with this virtual pin. It also sends an alert message to the Blynk Terminal widget (V13) indicating that the border has been crossed.

BORDER_CROSSED_MSG_PIN (V13): This virtual pin is used to display messages in the Blynk Terminal widget. When a border crossing is detected, the code sends a message to this virtual pin to inform the user that the border has been crossed.

FIRE_DETECTED_MSG_PIN (V14): This virtual pin is used to display messages in the Blynk Terminal widget. When the flame sensor detects a fire, the code sends a message to this virtual pin to inform the user that a fire has been detected.

Temperature (V0) and Humidity (V1) Display: These virtual pins are used to display temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor. The sendSensor() function reads these values and sends them to the respective virtual pins.

Distance Display (V3): This virtual pin is used to display distance values measured by the ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic() function reads the distance and sends it to this virtual pin.

GPS Data Display:

Latitude (V7): Displays the latitude value obtained from the GPS module.
Longitude (V8): Displays the longitude value obtained from the GPS module.
Speed (V9): Displays the speed value obtained from the GPS module.
Number of Satellites (V10): Displays the number of satellites value obtained from the GPS module.
Bearing (V11): Displays the bearing (direction) value obtained from the GPS module.
LED Widgets:

Flame Detection LED (V15): This virtual pin is used to control an LED widget to indicate the detection of a flame. When the flame sensor detects a fire, the LED widget associated with this virtual pin is turned on.
